# Gapminder Data Analysis for Country Development

In this project, the questions I am exploring are:

- Which countries have shown the least and the most development measured by these datasets and given variables between 1970 and 2009?
- What is the least and the most developed country in the world with the variables given?
- Have certain regions developed more within the given timeframe?

## About the Dataset

I have selected the following datasets for analysis from the Gapminder foundation's database:

- Total GDP (PPP, inflation-adjusted): PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. A PPP dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. Data are in constant 2005 international dollars.
- Total population
- Gini coefficient: Gini shows income inequality in a society. A higher number means more inequality.
- Mean years in school (women of reproductive age 15 to 44): The average number of years of school attended by all people in the age and gender group specified, including primary, secondary and tertiary education.
- Child mortality (0-5 year-olds dying per 1000 born): Death of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births.
- Life expectancy (years): The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.
