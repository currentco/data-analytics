with documentation available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554486256024000).

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that credit grading correlated with interest rates and the loan amounts. Expected relationships were found in the association between the risk estimation and variables considered affecting the risk factor.

It appears that borrowers with lower interest rates have higher credit grades and prospect ratings, bigger loans, are employed and own a home. Most of the current borrowers are employed and have higher credit grades.

The borrowers with higher interest rates, lower prosper ratings, lower monthly income and who are not homeowners end up more often with being late with payments or the loan being defaulted or charged off.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the process of data exploration and it's different stages. I start by introducing single variables and combining them with other categorical and numerical variables, followed by investigating and thoroughly plotting the relationships of selected variables. I will be using a multitude of different plots and coloring as appropriate.
